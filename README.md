# Guess the Distance

> A location-based "Guess the Distance" game for mobile platforms.

"Guess the Distance" is a small game for mobile platforms that support location services. The project is developed with Unity. It was originally created for use in lectures at the university to teach the principles of location-based services and spherical coordinate systems.

In the game you have to guess the distance from your current location to a city on the globe. Enter your answer in the input field and click "Guess". You score if your answer is not more than 10% off. How many cities in the world do you know? And more importantly, do you know where they are, and can you guess the distance correctly?
